## Wien-Bridge Oscillator to LED Full Bridge Rectifier

*IN PROGRESS*
  
This project is designed to showcase fundamentals of Electrical Engineering to first year students at the undergraduate level. The goal is to design a PCB in Altium, Spice, or KiCad for the oscillator. The oscillator will take -5V and +5V inputs from an Arduino Uno. The output of the oscillator will go to a full bridge rectifier constructed of red LEDs.

Progress of Oscillator output: ~ 1Hz output frequency design which is likely impacting the output magnitude and shape
